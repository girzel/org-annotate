;;; Commentary:

;; Provides a new link type for Org that allows you to create commentso
;; on arbitrary chunks of text.  The link prefix is "comment:".

;; Add comments with `org-comment-add-comment'.  Following the link
;; will display the text of the comment in a pop-up buffer.  The
;; buffer is in special-mode, hit "q" to dismiss it.

;; Call `org-comment-display-comments' to see all comments in a
;; buffer.  Press "?" in this buffer to see more options.

;; Customize how comments are exported in different backends by
;; setting the `org-comment-[backend]-export-function' options, where
;; "backend" is a valid backend identifier.  Each option should point
;; to a function that accepts two arguments, the path and description
;; strings of the link, and returns a single formatted string for
;; insertion in the exported text.  Some default functions are
;; provided for HTML, LaTeX and ODT, see the `org-comment-export-*'
;; functions.

;; Todo:

;; 1. Is it possible to have multi-line filled tabular list items?
;; Long comments are not very useful if you can't see the whole thing.

;; 2. Maybe a minor mode for ease of manipulating comments?

;; 3. Minor mode for the pop-up display buffer, inheriting from special-mode.
